# Balthier (Codename Hijacker)

Named after a pirate of the skies, Balthier (Hijacker) is api service
mocker and a json response builder. Its purpose is provide fake
repsonses that are compliant with user created contracts.

This is meant to speed up the development of UI's in case a developer
has an idea of how a certain api response will be structured and
wants to develop request/response related UI interactions, but the
backend has not completely implemented the route with the api response.

The best scenario for this would be a session of rapid prototyping or a
sales demo.
