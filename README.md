# Hijacker (Codename Balthier)

Named after a pirate of the skies, Balthier (Hijacker) is both a
response proxy and a json response builder. Its purpose is provide fake
repsonses that are compliant with user created contracts. 

This is meant to speed up the development of UI's in case a developer
has an idea of what a certain api response will be structured and
wants to develop request/response related UI interactions, but the
backend has not properly exposed the route of the API response.

The best scenario for this would be a session of rapid prototyping or a
sales demo.
